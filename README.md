#### This project is a project I made to learn about countries. While doing this project, we follow a way in which we can improve ourselves as a general culture. We see where the country you enter country's name is on the map and the country's information with a pop-up.

#### In this project, I used the open-source leaflet map and the population API by making fetch. It is a simple project that will write input in the name of the desired country and show it with a pointer to the country you want on the map.
